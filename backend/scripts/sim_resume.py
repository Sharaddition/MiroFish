"""Resume a stopped or interrupted run from its last finished round.

What a resume can and cannot do
-------------------------------
* The platform databases and ``actions.jsonl`` are kept. The log is cut back to the end of the last
  finished round (a round that started but did not finish is dropped and redone).
* The behaviour engine's scheduling (who is woken, reaction delays, scheduled events) depends only on the
  run seed and the configuration, never on what the model said. It is *replayed* for the finished rounds
  without any model call, so its random generators are exactly where they were, and the replay is checked
  against the ``active_agent_ids`` that were logged for every finished round.
* Agent chat memory lives in the process and is lost. A resumed run is therefore not identical to an
  uninterrupted one: agents remember what they read in the platform, not their earlier reasoning.

Exactness of the unfinished round
---------------------------------
After every finished round the run script writes a *checkpoint*: a consistent copy of the platform database
(``<db>.ckpt``) that carries the round number in a ``mirofish_checkpoint`` table, so the copy and its round
can never disagree. A resume restores it, which undoes whatever the unfinished round had already written.
A run that has no checkpoint (it was started before this feature) can still be resumed from the database as
it is; then the actions the unfinished round had already taken stay in the database and the round is redone
on top of them (``exact`` is False).

This module has no dependencies, so the backend and the run script can both use it.
